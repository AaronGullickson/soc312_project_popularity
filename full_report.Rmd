## Introduction

State the research question and why it is important to study in your own words.

## Data

Describe the dataset being used in your own words. Describe and show the distributions of key variables in the analysis. You can copy and past the code chunk below to produce figures. Be sure to change the `figuretemplate` name in each code chunk to a unique name or you will get a duplicate naming error. 

```{r figuretemplate, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A Caption"}
#code (e.g. plot, hist, barplot, boxplot) to produce the figure
```

## Results 

Describe the results of the full multivariate regression models. You can use the code chunk template below to place the regression results into a nice format using the stargazer package. 
```{r regression_template, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
#make some models
model1 <- lm()
model2 <- lm()
model3 <- lm()

#change type to "text" for inline test output, change back to "html" for knitting to html
stargazer(model1, model2, model3,
          type="html",
          keep.stat=c("n","rsq"),
          star.cutoffs = c(0.05,0.01,0.001),
          #covariate.labels = c("Covariate labels here"), #uncomment to add nice labels
          dep.var.labels.include = FALSE,
          dep.var.caption="Friend nominations",
          title = "Your caption here",
          notes.append=TRUE,
          notes.align="l",
          notes=c("Some notes","Some more notes"),
          header=FALSE)
```
