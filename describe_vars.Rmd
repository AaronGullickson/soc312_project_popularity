## Introduction 

State the research question and why it is important to study in your own words.

## Data

Describe the dataset being used in your own words. 

## Analysis

Describe each of the key variables in the analysis. You can copy and past the code chunk below to produce figures. Be sure to change the `figuretemplate` name in each code chunk to a unique name or you will get a duplicate naming error. 

```{r figuretemplate, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A Caption"}
#code (e.g. plot, hist, barplot, boxplot) to produce the figure
```
